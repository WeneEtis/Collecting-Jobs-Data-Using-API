# Collecting-Jobs-Data-Using-API
## Hands-on Lab 2: Collecting Data Using APIs
We are using two notebooks in this lab. First is Jobs_API which you just need to execute (No changes to be made here). Second is Collecting_Jobs_data_Using_API notebook in which you need to write the code and find the required results. Right click and open this link to download the Jupyter notebook. Then open it using Watson Studio and follow the instructions in the notebook to complete the lab.

Note: Both the notebooks are related to each other, so running Jobs_API notebook before the Collecting_Jobs_data_Using_API notebook is must.  Also, remember to upload both the notebooks in the same project in Watson.
